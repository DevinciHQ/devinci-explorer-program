## Goal: Setup A Linux Environment on your local machine

You have 3 basic options for setting up a local linux environment, a VM (Virtual Machine), Dual-boot, or Single Boot.

### VM (Virtual Machine):

You can use VirtualBox (free) to setup a VM on your local machine that will allow you to start and use linux without messing with your existing boot setup or resizing or formatting your hard drives. This is the easiest way to get started, but there are some drawbacks to running 2 operating systems simultaniously.

To simulate a basic installation of ubuntu unsing VirtualBox, you can follow these steps:

Download the DVD iso here: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop
 - Note this file is ~1GB so you'll need a good connection.

### Setup a dual-boot system:

This is also a good option if you want to be able to switch back and forth between linux and your normal OS (windows or OSX). You'll need to download the iso and burn it to a bootable DVD or Thumb drive.

### Setup a single boot system:

This is a good option when you don't need to run other operating systems and just want linux. It's sometimes better when you don't have a lot of disk space to store 2 different operating systems and all their associated files.
